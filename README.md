# Algorithm_Java Questions
How could we optimize a search algorithm?
Ans:    Once the piece of data you are searching for is found, you can return from the function.

What is the goal of an algorithm?
Ans:  To complete some task using a series of defined steps 

what can we use to optimize an algorithm?
Ans:    informed assumptions.

If an algorithm iterates through the input string and for each character, performs a check that takes O(1) time, what is the runtime complexity of the algorithm?
Ans:    O(n) or linear.
